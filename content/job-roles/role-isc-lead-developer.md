## Attitude

### Leadership

You are an organizational model for you colleagues. You live by best practices and require and help others to meet your high standards. You do your best to lead by consensus, listening to your team, but you always remember they look at you as a guide. You protect your team and remove obstacles but keep them committed and fit to create value.

### Decisiveness

You take promptly decisions, even on partial data, perceiving the overall impacts on people, schedule and deliverables. You face challenges proactively, not waiting for others to solve problems for you. You handle difficult situations without losing your mind and help others enduring them.

### Teamwork

You share your goals with your mates and work with them, never playing the hero or being a team of one. You speak your voice clearly, even when it's difficult, without holding relevant information for fear or stubborness. When being frank makes you uncomfortable, you still strive to be polite and cheerful so you can make your point.

### Self-organization

Your own schedule and workload balance is your responsibility. You have clear what's expected to you each iteration (week, sprint, milestone) and step up to discuss conflicting priorities and possible bottlenecks with the management.

### Lucidity

You have clear what's expected from you and what you have to do to match the expectation. When you feel like you lost your goals, you speak up and do your best to have them clear.

### Strong opinions, lightly held

You speak your mind and sustain your ideas with words and facts, but you are open to critics and listen with open ears.
