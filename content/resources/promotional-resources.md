This page lists a set of official resources that anyone in SparkFabrik may use for communication and promotion.

There are always the preferred assets: always make use of these templates and media, unless you have a very good reason not to.

## Presentation templates

We rely on Google GSuite for company documents. When you need to create a new presentation, refrain to use local/proprietary solutions and stick with what we chosed.  

We have two layouts for presentations, one with a **light** and one with a **dark** background.  
All Sparkfabrik employees may use their company accounts to access Drive and create a new presentation from one of the availabe templates (`Drive -> New -> Presentation -> From template` and choose the `Sparkfabrik GmbH` tab at the top).

Instructions on how to make the best out of those layouts are in the first page of each template.
