Operational roles are described in terms of **impact scoring cards**: documents that describe the expected positive impact a role has to the business.

As you take on new roles and possibly even move between specialities (we love multi-talented people), your accountabilities will be described by one (or more) scoring cards.

## Shared accountabilites

* Respect schedules and meetings (also push for the meeting, don't wait for others to push you)

@TODO: add here all relevant information

## Per-role accountabilities

* [Junior developer](/job-roles/role-isc-junior-developer)
* [Senior developer](/job-roles/role-isc-senior-developer)
* [Lead developer](/job-roles/role-isc-lead-developer)
* [Professional](/job-roles/role-isc-professional)
