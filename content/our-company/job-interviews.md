We are constantly evolving our hiring skills and practices.

What follow is a broad depiction of our hiring workflow, from first contact to job offer signing.
[Resource onboarding] has its own dedicated chapter in this playbook.

## How we collect CVs

Candidates apply via our company website or by mail, to jobs@sparkfabrik.com.
Please send your CV in the format that more represents your skills and attitude. Beside your CV a bit of a presentation is very welcome as it can help us understand who you are and what you exepect from us.

## First interview

We'll propose you a one-hour slot for a first interview. We'll both collect information about each other and will keep a record of our discussion for future reference.  
We do our best to get an interview with each and all candidates. Taking the first interview is not binding. If both we and you will be interested in establishing a job relation, we'll proceed to next steps.

The first interview has the following goals:

* Getting to know you, your attitude and your expectations in person.
* Giving you a taste of how working for us would be.

Let's get this out of the way: **we will value our personal impression more than any of the following parameters**.
Anyway, we'll ask you some question and score your replies. Here is how we calculate your scores.

### Knowledge of the company

**Max score: 6**

* You actually know what we do
* You read our [manifesto](https://www.sparkfabrik.com/en/manifesto.html)
* You read this playbook
* You know you offer something we are looking for
* You know we offer something you are looking for
* You get in touch with us in a non-fortuitous occasion (conferences, events, following on socials, etc)

### Self awareness

**Max score: 5**

* You can show you know your strenghts
* You can show you know your weaknesses
* You can elaborate on what you expect from your professional life (short, mid and long term)
* You are aware about how you see yourself in our company
* You can explain why you really want to work with us

### Attitude and personal skills

**Max score: 4**

* You can show passion for what you do, or what you want to do
* You have drive and will, not only at work
* You display or prove good social skills
* You show curiosity and interest about your future in our company

### Proficiencies

**Max score: 3**

* You can clearly elaborate on the skills mentioned in your CV
* You can show some of your work (either personal or professional)
* You can fluently hold a part of the conversation in English

More notes may be taken our side and maybe we won't go deep into each and every point here, but basically that's what we want to understand about you.

During the interview we'll devote 10 to 20 minutes replying your questions about the company.  
In addition, if you have any financial expectation, please be prepared to state it clearly during the first interview.

We commit to provide you with a honest feedback within two weeks from the interview. We may also ask your feedback about how the interview went so we can improve our practices. It would be great if you agree to be engaged in such a loop.

## Technical interview

Given you roll a critical hit during your first interview, we will call you back to hold a technical interview.

What "technical" means actually depends on your profile. Maybe you applied as a developer, UX designer, cloud engineer, agile product owner or whatever else. No matter what, in your technical interview we will get a grasp on your real proficiency and operational attitude. We will also answer your questions about how we do things and why. It has to be a conversation so we can both bring some value home.

`TBD`

```
- Skills and expertise
- Contributions to FOSS
- Passionate about the matter
- Experienced in agile metodologies
- Good communicator
- ...
```

## Technical challenge

Depending on your areas of proficiency, we will ask you to endure a technical challenge that can go from a few hours to a full day.
The goal of the technical challenge is to see you at work in our environment.

The actual challenge may change: you may have to produce something with a given technology, analyze a problem and provide your observation, explain and comment on something you produced in your spare time, dismantle a messy requirement in a set of user stories, reproduce a diabolical visual with CSS, or such.

No matter the challenge nature, you'll be assigned a mentor for it, so you know whom to talk to in case of need.

During the challenge you'll have access to the internet, our team, our offices and all the devices, tools and boons you would reasonably get in your everyday job. It is not a school exam and there is not always a bar to pass. It is instead a sort of benchmark that will give us an idea about:

* How you jump onto problems and tackle them
* How you face a healthy stress
* To what extent you can relate to others around you
* How proficient and productive you are during a (non standard) working day

On the other hand we want you to:

* Taste the general mood of our working environment
* Spend some times with your possible colleagues, like coffee-machine chat or lunch together
* Make questions about how we do things and why
* Speak your voice

You will be assigned a score, like follows.

### Social attitude

**Max score: 3**

* You reached out for help or a simple review by your mentor
* You managed to controll stress and kept a positive mood during the day
* You spent some time with other colleagues and learnt about how life in SparkFabrik actually is

### Self organization

**Max score: 3**

* You were able to set and maintanin tasklist to achieve your goals
* You managed to keep track of your progresses during the day
* You shown a clear understanding of your goal and can articulate about your progression (no matter how much) at the end of the challenge

### Technical skills

**Max score: 4**

* You produced something that actually works
* You can explain (sell?) your choices and tradeoffs
* You can engage in a meaningful conversation with your mentor about how the challenge went, possible improvements and the difficulties you encountered
* Your work is testable, be it by automated tests or by a human following clear scenarios

### Boons

**Any of the following may increase your score.**

* You helped us shape the challenge idea or raised the stake
* You put special care in some valuable aspects of your deliverable
* You provide honest and professional feedback on your experience that can help us shape future challenges
