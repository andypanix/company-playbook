SparkFabrik encourages team members to attend relevant conferences for personal development and to promote us around the industry.

## How to file an attendance request

If you wish to attend a conference, you must file your case using [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/sparkfabrik.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuDeQWDNWY6NEuznUBGfx6EtZTUCwwjpzH3qip-dfZvDXxSw/viewform).

To praise your contribution and good citizenship, we will give you *extra credits* in the evaluation of your case based on:

* Code/Design/Documentation contributions to our current active internal projects
* Blog posts published on [Tech @ SparkFabrik](http://tech.sparkfabrik.com)
* Organization of and presence to internal workshops/training sessions/hackaton

## What happens then?

The management board will consider the merits of conference attendance based on your case.

If many people want to attend **we may have to limit the total numbers** and will take into account if you already missed a conferennce previously. Anyway we'll do our best to make everyone benefit of this boon at least one time every year.

If accepted SparkFabrik will provide the following:

* Paid attendance to 1 or more days
* Paid return travel
* Accommodation costs for yourself if required depending on the distance required to travel
* Costs of evening meal for yourself if staying overnight (this follows the same rules as usual expenses policies around food and drink)

If the conference or conference travel is over a weekend then it is not considered a working day so SparkFabrik does not usually provide time _in lieu_.
If rejected, SparkFabrik will provide you with the reason why.
