SparkFabrik encourages team members to attend relevant conferences for personal development and to promote us around the industry.

If you wish to attend a conference, you must file your case using [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/sparkfabrik.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuDeQWDNWY6NEuznUBGfx6EtZTUCwwjpzH3qip-dfZvDXxSw/viewform).

To praise your contribution and good citizenship, we will give you *extra credits* in the evaluation of your case based on:

* Code/Design/Documentation contributions to our current active internal projects
* Blog posts published on [Tech @ SparkFabrik](http://tech.sparkfabrik.com)
* Organization of and presence to internal workshops/training sessions/hackaton

The management board will consider the merits of conference attendance based on your case.

If many people want to attend **we may have to limit the total numbers** and will take into account if you already missed a conferennce previously. Anyway we'll do our best to make everyone benefit of this boon at least one time every year.

If accepted SparkFabrik will provide the following:

1. Paid attendance to 1 or more days
2. Paid return travel
3. Accommodation costs for yourself if required depending on the distance required to travel
4. Costs of evening meal for yourself if staying overnight (this follows the same rules as usual expenses policies around food and drink)

If the conference or conference travel is over a weekend then it is not considered a working day so SparkFabrik does not usually provide time _in lieu_.
If rejected, SparkFabrik will provide you with the reason why.

The main contact for everything related to conferences and events attendance is [Paolo Mainardi](mailto:paolo.mainardi@sparkfabrik.com?subject='Conference application')

This policy and playbook page has been strongly inspired by the great [Deeson Handbook](http://handbook.deeson.co.uk/company-policies/conference-policy/). High-five guys!
